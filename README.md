Each file contains the coding solution as well as execution examples for testing purposes.

## Angular Solutions

The solutions to the Angular problems were divided into two routes that can be accessed through a button. The routing can be seen in the 'app-routing.module.ts' file.

The architecture was also divided into two folders for simplicity reasons: "sorter" for the Sorting problem and "repeater" for the repeater problem, both nested in the src/app folder.
